To make the paste, mix all the ingredients from the ground coriander to the water in a small bowl. Heat some oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat and add the spice mixture. Fry until reduced to a thick paste.
Heat some more oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 3-5 minutes, or until soft. Add the paste and garlic and stir over a low heat for another minute.
Add the chicken and cook until sealed, then add the chopped tomatoes and water. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer gently for 20 minutes or so.
Serve with rice and naan.
