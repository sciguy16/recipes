Sift the flour and salt into a bowl
Stir in the yeast and make a well in the centre
Gradually add the oil and sufficient water to form a soft dough, not too sticky
Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a floured surface or in a food mixer until smooth and elastic
Place in an oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise in a warm place for an hour or so
Knock back the dough and use as required. Can be stored overnight at this stage
