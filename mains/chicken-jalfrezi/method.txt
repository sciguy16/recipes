Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook for about 2 minutes
Add the chicken and turmeric, chilli powder, and salt. Keep the contents of the pan moving and scrape the bottom of the pan to prevent the spices from sticking and burning.

Add the butter, cumin, ground \& fresh corianders, and ginger and simmer for another 5 minutes or so.
