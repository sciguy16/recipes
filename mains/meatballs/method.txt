Combine the mince with 1 crushed garlic clove, 1\frac12 tablespoons of oregano, 1 tablespoon of basil, \frac12 tablespoon of parsley, \frac12 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper, 1\frac12 teaspoons of paprika and a little tomato puree in a mixing bowl.
Crush the Mini Cheddars into crumbs and add to the meat, followed by the egg.
Spread some flour onto a plate, then form the meat mixture into meatball-sized balls and roll each in the flour to get a light coating.
Fry the floured meatballs on a medium-high heat until the outsides are browned (they will finish cooking once they are in the sauce).
Set the browned meatballs aside (the previously floured plate is a good place for this).
Fry the chopped onion on its own, then add the chopped tomatoes, passata, and remaining spices (1 crushed clove of garlic, 1 tablespoon of oregano, 1 tablespoon of basil, 1 tablespoon of paprika)
Add the meatballs to the sauce in the pan and cook on a low heat for 1-2 hours, stirring periodically to prevent sticking/burning.
Serve with pasta and garlic bread.
