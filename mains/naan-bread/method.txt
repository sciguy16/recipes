Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Add milk, egg, and enough water to make a soft dough.
Knead until smooth, then place into a well oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Leave in a warm place to rise for about an hour.
Punch down dough and knead in garlic \& chillies. Pinch off small handfuls of dough, about golf ball sized, roll into balls and place on a plate or tray. Cover and allow to rise for a further 30 minutes.
Roll out balls of dough into thin circles and preheat large, lightly oiled frying pan to a reasonably high heat.
Brush one side of first dough circle with butter, and place butter-side down in the pan. Cook for a couple of minutes and brush the top side with butter. Flip and cook for a bit longer until done. Repeat for the other dough circles.
Alternatively, brush with butter (if practical) and place onto barbecue, remembering to flip the bread part way.
