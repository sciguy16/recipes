# recipes
A collection of delicious recipes


## Structure of this repository
Each recipe is broadly classified into either `main` or `dessert`, and then in an appropriately named directory.
The recipe directory contains three files:

* `description.txt` a text file containing a description of the recipe, e.g. number of people served. Acts as a bit of a README
* `ingredients.txt` list of ingredients
* `method.txt` one step per line, list of instructions
