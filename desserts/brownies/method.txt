Break the chocolate up into a bowl and add the butter. Fit the bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water and stir gently
When the butter and chocolate have melted, remove from heat and stir in the other ingredients (if adding chocolate chips then only add these at the end, after the other ingredients have been combined to prevent them from melting into the mixture)
Spread the mixture into a greased baking tin and bake at 180\textcelsius{} for 30~minutes
Allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then cut into squares.
